# Pictionary
A multiplayer pictionary application done in C# using the .NET framework.

## Intstructions
Compile project in Visual Studio. Exe-file will be under debug/ or release/. Use this file to host/connect to the game.

One player will be the host of the game. The host is able to choose what port the rest of the players will connect to.
The rest of the players will connect to the game by typing in the host's IP address and the chosen port.
The host has to create a txt.file (words.txt) containing words (one per line). Three random words will then be drawn from this pool of words every turn.
